                    <ul>
                        <li>Growing up in Seattle, I am avid outdoorsmen, which has led me to develop 
                        the passion of fishing! I ended teaching myself many of the basic skills on 
                        YouTube and spent a lot of my pocket money purchasing gear. It is a great activity 
                        to relax and have fun in nature.</li>
                        <li>In my free time, I love to practice and train myself in the sport of basketball.
                        Although I ended up liking the sport quite late, I try everyday to improve myself so 
                        that I become a an overall better player.</li>
                        <li>When I am at home and usually “drowning in boredom,” I love to grab a book off of 
                        my bedroom bookshelf and spend long periods of time devlving in the mystical and adventurous 
                        worlds that various storties present to me.</li>
                        <li>As a big tech nerd, I have to say that I really enjoy video games. From the classic
                        Mario Brother games on the Nintendo to massive RPG’s like Assassins Creed on the Xbox/PS4, 
                        video games not only provide the opportunity to pass time in a ‘enjoyable’ manner, but also really 
                        sparked my passion for technology.</li>
