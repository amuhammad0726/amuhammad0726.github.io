                        During the summer of my junior year in 2021, I participated in an internship with the Teens in 
                        Public Service Organization, which pairs teenage students with various non-profit organizations in 
                        order to instill in them various leadership skills and provide them a means of giving back to their community.

                        At TIPS, I worked with the non-profit organization called Pratt Fine Arts Center where I assisted them in documenting 
                        student artwork through engaging in multiple classes and producing high-quality videos in order to advertise the coursework 
                        as well.

                        Kumon is an academic tutoring center that focuses on improving students' skills in the subject areas of math and reading 
                        through personal tutoring and additional practice assignments.

                        At Kumon, I was tasked with the role of an assignment grader and student-tutor, which meant that I was responsible for grading 
                        student homework, ranging from both basic to more advanced levels and also working with students one on one in order to develop 
                        their skills in these areas.

                        Additionally, I worked to make sure the center was organized and also made sure it was sanitized during 
                        this pandemic period.
